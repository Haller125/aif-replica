# Next.js Web Page Replica

This repository contains a Next.js application that serves as a replica of [AIF site](https://astanainternationalforum.org/en). The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of Next.js in creating high-performance, server-rendered React applications.

## Features
- **TypeScript:** Written in TypeScript for improved code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **next-i18next:** Internationalization framework for Next.js applications.
- **Swiper:** Modern mobile touch slider with hardware-accelerated transitions.
- **react-hook-form:** Performant, flexible, and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.
- **react-select:** Highly customizable select/dropdown components with support for async options.
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
